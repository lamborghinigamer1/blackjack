# Blackjack

## What's this?

Blackjack is a card game commonly played in casinos. I decided to make this project in Rust, because I also have a Discord bot written in Rust and just want a simple way to add parameters and change up the game. Another reason is that I'm practicing Object Oriented Programming and just felt like making it in my free time.

## Rules of Black Jack

1. Each player place their bets.

2. The dealer gives every player from the deck 2 cards each containing 2 values. In total from 2 all the way up to 21.

3. The dealer asks each player if they want another card.

4. If a player or the dealer goes over 21, they have gone bust.

5. If a player or the dealer has 5 cards they automatically lose (Five card charlie).

6. When someone wins they receive all the bets, but if it's a tie the one that drew get their bet back.
